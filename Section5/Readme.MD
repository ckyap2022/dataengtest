#Section 5: Machine Learning Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, 
create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

Maintenance = High 
Number of doors = 4 
Lug Boot Size = Big 
Safety = High 
Class Value = Good

#Attribute Values:

buying       v-high, high, med, low
maint        v-high, high, med, low
doors        2, 3, 4, 5-more
persons      2, 4, more
lug_boot     small, med, big
safety       low, med, high
class values unacc, acc, good, vgood
